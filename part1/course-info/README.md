# 📘 Course Information App

This is a small React project built as part of the **Full Stack Open** course (Exercises 1.1–1.5). The application displays details about a course, including: 
- The **course name**
- Each **part's name** and **number of exercises**
- The **total number of exercises**

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Modular React components  
- ✅ Props used to pass data between components  
- ✅ Total exercises calculated from data  
- ✅ Clean, simple UI using only JSX and basic styling

## 🧱 App Structure
The app consists of the following components:
- **Header** – displays the course name  
- **Content** – lists all parts with exercise counts  
- **Part** – renders each individual part  
- **Total** – calculates and shows the total exercises

All components are defined inside `App.jsx` to match the exercise instructions.
