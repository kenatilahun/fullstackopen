Course Information App

This is a simple React application created for the Full Stack Open course. The app displays information about a course, including its name, the individual parts, and the number of exercises in each part. It also calculates and shows the total number of exercises.

The app demonstrates basic usage of React components and props. It uses functional components to render the course name (Header), list the parts (Content), and calculate the total exercises (Total). Data is passed from the App component to its children through props.

The structure of the application includes the App.jsx file which contains the main logic, and is rendered through main.jsx. All logic and components are contained in a single file as per the instructions.

How to run the app:
- Make sure you have Node.js installed
- Navigate to the project directory in the terminal
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
- Open the local server URL (usually http://localhost:5173) in your browser to view the app

This app does not use any advanced features like state or conditional rendering, since the course parts and exercises are static. It serves as an introduction to React component structure and passing data through props.

This project corresponds to exercises 1.1 through 1.5 in the Full Stack Open course.
